# Wordle Clone

A Javascript clone of the popular game [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html).

## How to Play

Wordle is a game to guess a five letter word in 6 tries. To play the game, either use your keyboard or the in-app keyboard to type a 5-letter word. 

If you make a mistake, use the DEL button or Backspace key to go back. 

When you want to submit your guess, press the Enter key.

The game will end if the word is correct, but if not, then each letter in the guess will be marked with one of three outcomes:
* If the letter is in the correct spot, it will turn green.
* If the letter is not in the correct spot but is in the word, it will turn yellow.
* If the letter is not in the word at all, it will turn grey.

From there, the game will continue until either the word is guessed correctly, or the user runs out of tries. Refresh the page to play again!
